<dd>Use RM2_ReplicaManager in <a class="el" href="ReplicaManager2_8h.html">ReplicaManager2.h</a> <a class="el" href="classReplicaManager.html">ReplicaManager</a> is a system manager for your game objects that performs the following tasks: 1. Tracks all locally registered game objects and players and only performs operations to and for those objects and players 2. Allows you to automatically turn off unneeded local and remote functions for your game objects, thus providing convenience and security against unauthorized sends. 3. Sends notifications of existing game objects to new connections, including a download complete message. 4. Sends notifications of new game objects to existing players. A. Serialize and scoping calls are not sent to objects that were not notified of that object. B. Notification calls can be canceled on a per-object basis. Object notification sends are tracked on a per-system per-object basis. 5. Configurable per-system per-object scoping. A. Scoping provides a mechanism to hide and unhide remote objects without destroying the whole object, used when when entities should not be destroyed but are currently not visible to systems. B. Serialize calls are not sent to hidden objects. C. Scoping calls can be canceled on a per-object basis. Scope is tracked on a per-system per-object basis. 6. Replicate, SetScope, SignalSerializeNeeded, and the corresponding <a class="el" href="classReplica.html">Replica</a> interfaces are processed in <a class="el" href="classRakPeer.html#30f9b6c0108bae2b860776136f6aece7">RakPeer::Receive</a>, rather than immediately. A. This allows the <a class="el" href="classReplicaManager.html">ReplicaManager</a> to reorganize function calls in order by dependency. This allows out of order calls, per-object call cancellation (which also cancels dependencies), and per-object call delays (which also delays dependencies) B. For example, although SetScope and SignalSerializeNeeded have a dependency on SetNetworkID(), you can still call them in the constructor and call SetNetworkID() later, as long as it happens before calling <a class="el" href="classRakPeer.html#30f9b6c0108bae2b860776136f6aece7">RakPeer::Receive()</a> 7. The system is fast, uses little memory, and is intentionally hands off such that it can work with any game architecture and network topology<p>
