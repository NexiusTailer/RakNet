2.002 Fixed using domain names with clients<BR>
2.003 Removed feedback loop test code with RakVoice<BR>
2.01 Added ID_REMOTE_EXISTING_CONNECTION (client only).  This is sent to clients that have just connected to a server, one message per existing client on the network.  Also fixed a bug where static data was not sent to new clients from existing clients.<BR>
2.011 Specifying UNASSIGNED_PLAYER_ID for SendStaticData wasn't broadcasting when it should have been.<BR>
2.012 Fixed a case where ID_REMOTE_CONNECTION_LOST was reported incorrectly.  THe connection was not actually lost, just the report was wrong.<BR>

2.4 Make duplicate packet tracking memory dynamic, reducing average memory use by 25X. Fixed bug with secure connections not responding to out of order replies. Cirilo Bernardo made the BitStream class and most tests endian complaint. Fixed handling ordered packets that arrived more than 2 out of order. Fixed formatting broken by a contributor. Fixed resend queue counting "Holes" towards the overall size, blocking sends if a single packet was lost with subsequent packets not lost.<BR>
2.401 Fixed contributor bug causing the first PlayerIndex to use an invalid value on the client.<BR>
2.402 Fixed a rare case where if a player disconnected and another player connected right away you could still read leftover packets from the disconnected player.<BR>
2.41 Order of magnitude performance improvement. Reduced memory requirement by about 25%. Added plugin system, with a fully connected mesh plugin. Fixed bug with not detecting duplicate packets when the packet counter wrapped.<BR>
2.411 Fixed lost connection being reported if no data sent by the user for 10 seconds.<BR>

Added automatic memory synchronization message handler.  Added class member RPC calls.  Added ability to pass data with Advertise System. Re-fixed memory leak in Array class. No longer include DemonBattle sample to cut down on download size.<BR>
2.418 Made changes so it would compile under DevCPP and hopefully Linux.<BR>
2.419 Replaced AES128.h/.cpp with Rijndael.h/Rijndael.cpp to hopefully be different-endian portable.  Updated NetworkIDGenerator so you can include it as a member object to generate IDs rather than inheritance.<BR>
2.42 Bunch of minor changes thanks to pinniped. Also a preliminary version of my data replication plugin.<BR>
2.43 Added PacketLogger plugin. Renamed MessageHandlerInterface PluginInterface. Renamed DataReplication DataReplicatorTest. Updated Doxygen documentation. Revamped DataReplicator plugin (work in progress).<BR>
2.431 Added HelloWorld video tutorial.  Revised DataReplication system to where it's stable enough to release without a warning.  Depreciated DistributedNetworkObject class and sample, which is now superceded by the DataReplication system.<BR>

Added Write and Read functions to bitstream for matrices, vectors, and quaternions. Added current time parameter to data replicator memory callback (because calling RakNet::GetTime is slow).<BR>
2.44 Added WriteDelta and WriteCompressedDelta to BitStream class.  Changed BitStream class to use template and template specialization for native types.  Bitstreams can now read and write PlayerIDs directly.  Added replyFromTarget parameter to RPC so you can now use RPC as a blocking function that takes a reply from a remote system.  Improved performance of SingleProducerConsumer class and fixed a small chance of overrun or underruns on multiprocessor systems. Improved documentation for DataReplicatorSystem. Clarified ObjectMemberRPC example.  Replaced critical section lock on incoming packet queue with a single producer consumer, improving read throughput rate by about 200%.<BR>
2.444 Updated all header file documentation for Doxygen.  Tweaks to the data replicator system.<BR>
2.45 Fix Linux compatibility.  Simplified data replicator by removing property flags. Increased size of OrderingIndexType to unsigned short so you can reorder more than 256 out-of-order ordered packets on the same channel at a time.  This fixes the rare bug report where ordered packets arrive out of order due to extreme send rates with high packetloss.<BR>
2.451 Fixed bug where dropped connections were not detected as long as you kept sending to the dropped system.  WriteVector, etc. in the BitStream class can now take doubles as well as floats.  Fixed an invalid assert when passing 0 to the fully connected mesh as the password.<BR>
2.452 Fixed not detecting dropped connections when only one packet was being resent.<BR>
2.453 Improve template compatibility.<BR>
2.454 Master server / Master client now uses Plugin interface. Fixed bug that appeared on Linux where out of older order packets were incorrectly treated as duplicate and dropped.  Same fix reduces memory usage by about 400 bytes per player. Reorganized packet resend loop to hopefully fix a reported infinite loop. Added define _COMPATIBILITY_1 to exclude compilation of code that uses alloca, FormatMessage, the security layer, gethostbyname, #include <windows.h>
<p>, and inet_ntoa.  This define also changes the default MTU to 1492. Updated documentation for memory synchronization of DataReplicator. Updated FAQ. Added OnDetatch to the PluginInterface.<BR>
  2.455 Fixed many gcc warnings.  Fixed error where alloca wouldn't compile under Code::Blocks<BR>
  2.456 Add channel parameter to functions RakPeer::Disconnect and RakPeer::CloseConnection. Added RakPeer::SetTimeoutTime and removed constant TIMEOUT_TIME. Optimized network thread playerID lookup from O(n) to O(log2(n)), which will improve directed send speeds when a server or peer has many connected systems. Added SetNetworkSimulator procedure so the network simulator can be activated, deactivated, and be adjusted by users at runtime.  Added checking for _FINAL define, to exclude code that would never be used in release builds.  Currently only applies to the NetworkSimulator<BR>
  2.457 Fixed harmless assert on startup in ReliabilityLayer::SetPing. Fixed uninitialized variable read when sending ID_ADVERTISE_SYSTEM with no user data. Fixed search indexing bug in OrderedList causing performance loss. Increased DataReplicator memory registration limit from 255 to 65535.<BR>
  2.46 Added IsObjectListPushComplete to the DataReplicator system.  The DataReplicator class factory now has access to the creation send and request data.  Added CommandConsoleServer and CommandConsoleClient. Padded single byte packets to 2 bytes to fix some router issues.<BR>
  2.461 Exported most of the user classes, so if you are using a DLL you don't have to include the source. Added more functions to RakNetworkFactory to new and delete those classes. Fixed an assert in DataReplicator. Added const to StringCompressor::EncodeString and AdvertiseSystem. Fixed projects so they all build.<BR>
  2.47 Released first iteration of ReplicaManager, which replaces DataReplicator, which I will no longer include in distributions.  Added ReplicaManagerCS and ReplicaManagerP2P samples.  Added missing *identifierFound=true in GetServerListRuleAsInt.  Added OnCloseConnection to PluginInterface. The NetworkID generator system now supports peer to peer. Added StringTable class.<BR>
  2.48 Fixed critical bug where if an unreliable packet was lost all further data would be considered duplicate. In the ReplicaManager you can now use objects without calling construct first.  The BitStream class for VC6 reverts to the old BitStream that didn't use templates.  Renamed ObjectID NetworkID and renamed UNASSIGNED_OBJECT_ID UNASSIGNED_NETWORK_ID.<BR>
  2.481 All changes to the ReplicaManager: Added ReferencePointer. Using a default scope of true will no longer trigger SendScopeChange and ReceiveScopeChange calls for that true default value. Functions now use the return type ReplicaReturnResult.  All 3 callbacks now include a ReplicaManager * to the manager. Fixed bug setting bitwise enumerations for commands for the ReplicaManager.<BR>
  2.482 Removed mutex locks for incoming and outgoing password. Bug fixes for ReplicaManager. Added 64 bit time support.<BR>
  2.483 (04/19/06) Replaced %8 with &7 in BitStream.cpp.  Thanks to Oliver Smith for pointing this out. Changed offline pings to be totally offline, rather than connecting and then disconnecting.  This might fix the reported bug with pinging and not being able to reconnect. Reordered packet enumerations so that the most commonly used ones are first.  Updated readme.txt.<BR>
  2.484 (04/21/06) Fixed stack overflow problem when sending RPC packets with more data than the stack can hold (via define MAX_ALLOCA_STACK_ALLOCATION).  Added PlayerID::ToString(). Converted Bitstream constructor char *'s to unsigned char *'s so you can pass Packet::data to it without casting. Fixed memory leak if you disconnected with unread packets waiting (Thanks to "riley" and "Greg" in the forums).  Removed various warnings.  Updated Linux ChatExample (thanks to Oliver Stone for sending me the files).<BR>
  2.485 (04/27/06) Fixed bug with not being able to do cross-connections.  Renamed all data structures with DS_ and changed namespace to DataStructure.<BR>

Fixed memory leak if sending an RPC to a system that disconnected between the user call and the network thread doing the send. Removed maximum message size limit of (formerly) 91 megabytes, improved CPU efficiency of message reassembly, and decreased per-split bandwidth usage by 2 bytes. Fixed bug where you could get recursive RPC calls with blocking RPCs. Added _RAKNET_THREADSAFE to support multiple writer and reader threads using the same instance of RakPeer. BitStream.h should now compile on Visual Studio 2005.<BR>

  3.2 (4/15/08) NAT Punch through now uses duplex symmetric port prediction, resulting in a vastly higher success rate. Fixed a bug in SingleProducerConsumer resulting in a 12 byte memory leak per message sent or received in release. Thanks to cmusch in the forums for finding this.<BR>
  3.21 (4/20/08) Reverted to speex-1.1.12 to fix broken voice activity detection. Turned on voice activity detection by default to fix a bug where the voice latency increases over time. Add "SuperFastHash" to speed up DirectoryDeltaTransfer and Autopatcher file scans by 30%. Add file RakThread for easier cross-platform thread creation.<BR>
  3.22 (05/04/08) Fixed TTL send not working for NAT punch through. TCPInterface now has a nonblocking option for connections.

Added PHPDirectoryServer project.<BR>
  3.23 (05/11/08) Fix subtraction underflow caused by bad GetTime() values for ReliabilityLayer. This could cause reliable packets that were lost due to packetloss to never be resent. Added RakPeerInterface::IsLocalIP(). Fixed PostgreSQL implementation of autopatcher. Added MySQL implementation of autopatcher. Fixed SQL injection security holes with autopatcher server. Add TLS support to TCPInterface, allowing the EmailSender class to send through Gmail. Fixed infinite recursive call under DevCPP and MinGW caused by #define with stricmp.<BR>
  3.24 (06/16/08) Autopatcher: optimized MySQL queries, fixed file list transfer callback, improved Linux compatibility.

BitStream now supports Read functions for other bitstreams.<BR>
  3.26 (08/28/08) Add IsSendingVoiceData to RakVoice. Remove GetTickCount() call in GetTime.cpp. On Vista it was found to frequently return a past result off by rangeof(unsigned int), causing all connections to be dropped. Workaround Vista bug returning WSAEADDRINUSE when binding a socket after previously closing one on the same port. Add OnConstructionComplete to Replica2. Add ExecVaridic to PostgreSQLInterafce. Fix for sending offline messages using an unknown hostname. Add WSAStartupSingleton.h for SocketLayer.cpp and TCPInterface.cpp. Support incremental sends for FileListTransfer, reducing memory use for large file sends.

Speed up AutopatcherMySQLRepository with indices. Thanks for varmint from the forums for the last two tips.<BR>
  3.3 (10/24/08) ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED is now RELIABLE_ORDERED on channel 0. 
  Added a threadsafe version of SystemAddress::ToString().
  Secure connections code has been rewritten for better speed (Thanks Catid). 
  RakVoice will now check for initialization before accepting remote chat requests. 
  Added RakNetGUID to uniquely identify instances of RakPeer. Use RakPeer::GetGuidFromSystemAddress() and RakPeer::GetSystemAddressFromGuid. GUIDs are contained in the Packet structure and within offline messages. 
  Fixed bug with BitStream::WriteVector(). 
  NATPunchthrough now supports cross connections. Reciever will now properly open all attempted connection addresses, rather than only the first one.
  Added RAKNET_PROTOCOL_VERSION and ID_INCOMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL_VERSION, returned for incompatible RakNet versions on Connect() calls.

  LightweightDatabaseServer will no longer incorrectly remove a row if you do not call RakPeer::Update() for a long time.
  Various ReplicaManager2 fixes for non-authoritative client created objects.
  Packet logger now shows acks and RakPeer::PushBackPacket commands. Also, now shows the correct messageID for regular sends.

  Switch plugins to use PluginInterface2, replacing PluginInterface, in order to support TCP.
  Add PacketizedTCP class, sending discrete messages through TCP.
  Support PacketizedTCP with the Autopatcher and FileListTransfer. Using TCP, the autopatcher can self-update even when RakNet's protocol changes.<BR>
  3.51 (04/17/09) Added UDPProxy feature, to forward datagrams in case of NATPunchthrough failure.
  Added ReplicaManager3 plugin. ReplicaManager2 is now depreciated.

  Added ConnectionGraph2 and FullyConnectedMesh2 plugins.
  RakNetTransport2 plugin added, which works as a plugin instead of creating its own instance of RakPeer. RakNetTransport, which did that, is now depreciated.
  Deleted FCMHost plugin (replaced by FullyConnectedMesh2).
  ReplicaManager3 fix for not sending serialization to new connections when using identical serialization.
  Various fixes for Lobby2 system.
  Fix crash in LightweightDatabaseServer if not automatically storing system address.
  Added DependentExtensions\IrrlichtDemo 
  Disallow reconnecting when the remote system thinks you are still connected, if using a different IP but the same RakNetGUID.
  Added RakPeerInterface::GetSystemList to return connected SystemAddress and RakNetGUID in a list.
  Various fixes for DirectoryServer.php. PHPDirectoryServer::ProcessHTTPRead now returns an enumeration, rather than a string, to indicate results.
  RakNetTime is now 64 bit by default. Comment __GET_TIME_64BIT in RakNetDefines.h to change to 32 bit.
  UDP proxy system now automatically chooses best server. If more than one server is available, and both source and target relay systems are running RakNet, then source and target will ping all available servers. The servers will be attempted in order of lowest ping sum to highest.
  Updated FAQ. Updated manual for NATPunchthrough.<BR>
  3.6 (05/26/09) Fixed define bug with BIG_ENDIAN to __BIG_ENDIAN__ in BigInt.
  Fixed FullyConnectedMesh2.
  Bind whichever address a message came in on, so we always reply on the same address. This fixes an issue where you have multiple IP addresses and reply on a different address than what the sender used. This also means RakNet no longer necessarily uses a single socket for all communications.
  Added RakNetSocket structure, with GetSockets accessor in RakPeerInterface. This can be used to find out which ports and IP addresses you have locally bound.
  Added ConnectWithSocket to RakPeerInterface. Removed RebindSocket.
  Added UPNP implementation from Codeproject to Samples, with fixes. Added to NATPunchthrough sample.
  NATPunchthrough now supports 0 for the MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_INTERNAL_IDS_TO_CHECK parameter.
  Fixed ReplicaManager3 serialization bugs with RM3SR_SERIALIZED_IDENTICALLY, and with serializing to more than 3 systems. Also validate connections before using them, so we know the other system has created the connection first.
  ReplicaManager3 QueryConstruction is now only called when the object does not already exist. If it does already exist, QueryDestruction is called instead.
  Added RakPeerInterface::GetTimeoutTime()
  Added time row was written to PacketLogger.
  UDPForwarder, and thus the proxy server, now runs in its own thread.
  UDPForwarder does not set the source or destination port until the first message arrives, to handle symmetric NATs changing ports.
  UDPForwarder now returns a result enumeration indicating success, bad parameters, in progress, or failed
  Flow control will now subtract average times between thread updates from pings. This fixes a problem where uneven times between thread context switches caused reported pings to fluctuate constantly, resulting in flow control dropping to the minimum level. This should fix an issue encountered by Stardock, with messages buffered and taking a long time to send.
  Fix issue with UDPProxyCoordinator, where two systems would simultaneously start forwarding to each other, but one system report success before the other knew about it, resulting in two forwarding entries.
  Add modified UDT source to RakNet distribution, under DependentExtensions\udt4. Comment out _USE_RAKNET_FLOW_CONTROL in RakNetDefines.h to use (Still has bugs, do not use for now).
  Fix TCPInterface with DeltaDirectoryTransfer
  Fixed bug introducted by checking RakNetGUID on new connections from 3.52, where connection replies were only sent once, rather than on each request.
  Added parameter to CloseConnection to select priority on which to send ID_DISCONNECTION_NOTIFICATION.
  Added SQLLite3Plugin to DependentExtensions\SQLite3Plugin. This allows you to do database calls over the internet with SQLLite3, which is normally only supported with networked file handles. This replaces LightweightDatabase, which is now depreciated.<BR>
  3.61 (07/21/2009) Fix memory leak in single producer single consumer.
  Fix RakNetGUID initilization where only the first 4 ints were initialized.
  Fix RakNet::OP_NEW mistmatch in DS_Table, causing a crash.

  Update Doxygen comment syntax to produce better Doxygen output.
  Fix misspelling of Variadic.
  Depreciate PHPDirectoryServer due to unreliable replies. Now supplanted with PHPDirectoryServer2
  Rooms plugin can now send arbitrary bitstreams through the server.
  Near rewrite of ReplicaManager3. Optimized from O(n^3) to O(n). Now supports multiple serialization channels.
  Autopatcher source files moved from /DependentExtensions to DependentExtensions\Autopatcher . Also the samples use TCP by default now.
  Fix endian swapping with OFFLINE_MESSAGE_DATA_ID
  FullyConnectedMesh2 host determination rewritten for better consistency and reliability from unresponsive hosts.
  Updated samples with new IP address of free server.
  Disabled forced port bindings. This apparently causes the Vista to reject the reply messages, which is a more serious bug than getting a reply on a different port.
  FileListTransferCBInterface::OnFileStruct renamed members: finalDataLength to byteLengthOfThisFile, totalDownloadedLength to bytesDownloadedForThisFile, setCount to numberOfFilesInThisSet, setTotalFinalLength to byteLengthOfThisSet, setTotalDownloadedLength to bytesDownloadedForThisSet.
  Fix NatPunchthroughServer not working on linux due to time subtraction, and hence underflow. Also made static string buffers larger to support 6 integer RakNetGUID.
  Change gmail port for email sender sample.
  Added critical section locks to the referenced counted pointers in RakString, to support multithreaded use.
  BitStream will now use memcpy if possible when writing other bitstreams.

Fix NatPunchthroughClient::OpenNAT, so you can connect to a system more than once. Fix Lobby2 GetAccountDetails. Add SQLImageBuffer test, and jpeg-7 to DependentExtensions. Forgot ResetWritePointer in Connection_RM3::SendConstruction. Fix Lobby2 bugs with PerTitleIntegerStorage. Fix RM3 not serializing preexisting objects that don't change to new connections.<BR>
  3.7 RC2 (09/10/2009) Fixed 32 to 64 bit connection problem for all versions. Fix endian swapping connection problem from RC1. There is now one thread per receive socket to increase timestamp accuracy for congestion control. Fix crash on shutdown when using ban lists. Improve bandwidth estimation. Linux now pthread_cond_timedwait rather than sleep, for better performance.<BR>
  3.7 (9/23/2009) Send() function player lookup is now O(1) in most cases, rather than O(log2(n)); Added SQLiteServerLogger, SQLiteClientLogger, SQLiteClientLogger_RakNetStatistics, and SQLiteClientLogger_PacketLogger. Fixed TCPInterface low transfer speed. Fixed PacketizedTCP not updating plugins correctly. Fixed SignaledEvent usage on Linux (bug from 3.7 RC2)<BR>
  3.702 (10/15/2009) Speed up lookup on RakPeer::Send() from O(log2n) to O(1) by using systemIndex automatically when available. Reduce number of RakStrings allocated at once to 128 from 1024. Sped up TCPInterface. Return ID_CONNECTION_LOST if calling CloseConnection with sendDisconnectionNotification false.<BR>
  3.704 (10/22/2009) Autopatcher: Workaround for design flaw in PostgreSQL and possibly MySQL, where calls on a connection are not threadsafe across different threads. Instead of calling SetAutopatcherRepositoryInterface, you must now call StartThreads(), with an array of AutopatcherRepositoryInterface, 1 per thread. StartThreads() must also be called now before AutopatcherServer will process any messages. This was previously causing crashes/corrupted data if a transfer was in progress through FileListTransfer at the same time that the old autopatcher thread was querying the database for a different connection. Additionally, the autopatcher now supports multiple simultaneous threads. Previously it only ran one thread at a time. Also sped up FileListTransfer for incremental reads in the case when there are many files and more than one connection. ReplicaManager3: Add lastSentBitstream pointer to SerializeParameters. Fix UDPForwarder not setting timeout parameter. <BR>
  3.705 (10/29/2009) Added ResetHostCalculation to FullyConnectedMesh2. Increased default memory usage to avoid datagram index overflowing on a LAN. Made this value customizable in RakNetDefines.h, and added RakNetDefinesOverrides.h to make overriding easier. Update IsPortInUse to account for multiple IP addresses. Added default implementation of dlmalloc. Use by defining _RAKNET_SUPPORT_DL_MALLOC and _USE_RAK_MEMORY_OVERRIDE. Added Demo_BspCollision from Ogre3D to for SQLiteClientLogger sample.
  3.7051 (11/07/2009) Reduce memory usage. Fix FileListTransfer bytesDownloadedForThisFile.<BR>
  3.71 (11/16/2009) Note: This version is not network compatible with 3.7051 or earlier due to reordering of packet enumerations.
  Bug fixes: Fix MySQL autopatcher not working (bug from 3.704). Fix bug in RakPeer::Shutdown() where used sockets were never freed. Fixed a bug where the MTU size was always set at the lowest value, causing needless fragmentation.
  Congestion control: Change tolerance algorithm for ping variations. The old algorithm was designed for a LAN, and was causing excess packetloss over long-distance internet connections.
  Performance: Remove all but 1 memory allocation per send and per receive, in order to reduce memory fragmentation. With messages larger than the MTU, reference the original data block rather than allocating and copying fragments. Expose the thread priority in RakPeer::Startup() and TCPInterface::Startup(), for Linux based systems that do not define a default normal thread priority.
  New features: Add connection failure enumeration ID_IP_ALREADY_CONNECTED. ID_IP_ALREADY_CONNECTED is returned if RakPeer::SetLimitIPConnectionFrequency() was set. Packet priorities now schedule sends, where each lower priority level is sent half as frequently as the priority level above. Updated Irrlicht 3D demo to Irrlicht 1.6.<BR>
  3.711 Fix messages of certain size combinations causing further sends to never go out.
  Add ability to pass GUID to UDPProxyClient::RequestForwarding, and use this by default in the samples.
  Reduce memory usage.
  Improve randomness of random number for FullyConnectedMesh2<BR>
  3.712 Improve security for client-specified RakNetGUID. UDPForwarder: Fix uninitialized variables.<BR>
  3.713 Use hash lookup instead of sorted list lookup for packets from remote systems, since speed is so important for that. Ping based congestion control.<BR>
  3.714 (12/06/2009) Fix random crash in ReliabilityLayer. Possible fix for ID_ALREADY_CONNECTED, and increased randomization of GUID.<BR>
  3.715 (12/11/2009) Fix bug returning ID_ALREADY_CONNECTED. You can now also pass a RakNetGuid to most places in RakPeer you previously passed a SystemAddress. Change disconnect timeout method.<BR>
  3.716 (12/29/2009) Fix bug introduced in 3.714 causing players to get disconnected. FileListTransfer now supports incremental writes in addition to incremental reads. Reduce per-datagram overhead by 4 bytes once the bandwidth capacity has been determined.<BR>
  3.717 (1/05/2010) Fix a hashing bug affecting players reconnecting. Add RakPeerInterface::IsConnectionAttemptPending<BR>
  3.718 (02/04/2010) 64 bit to 32 bit network communication fixes. Lower second attempt MTU detection to 1200. Skip MTU sends that will fail anyway. Add TeamBalancer plugin. Add signals and slots support for RPC3. Fixed autopatcher. Add Router2 plugin, to route messages in a fully connected mesh, when two peers cannot directly connect. Add IMMEDIATE_PRIORITY, above HIGH_PRIORITY. With IMMEDIATE_PRIORITY, messages will be sent immediately, rather than joined with other messages for more efficient bandwidth usage. RakVoice now refers to other systems by RakNetGUID, rather than SystemAddress, in order to work properly with NAT punchthrough. Fixed various warnings for Linux. Fixed pure virtual function call in Lobby2Server when shutting down. Fixed Client_GetAccountDetails for lobby2. Changed implementation of BitStream::WriteNormVector to handle small numbers. Added UPNPPortForwarder as a replacement nonblocking interface to the old UPNP system.<BR>
  3.72 (02/27/2010)
  PS3: Added dice sample
  FileListTransfer: Fixed divide by 0 crash when using incremental reads.
  Cmake: Fixed, all other projects and makefiles removed for Linux.
  UPNP: Fixed
  BitStream: Added WriteRef, and use with the shift left operator, so that RPC3 does not do a pass-by-value on object writes. This fixes a problem where the pass-by-value caused the destructor to be called on the copied object.
  ReplicaManager3: Replace AutoConstructByQuery with QueryConstructionMode, and added QueryReplicaList, for better performance for massively multiplayer games.
  TelnetTransport: You can now press the up arrow key to repeat the last command.
  RakPeer: Fix IMMEDIATE_PRIORITY to send right away when called by the user.
  Router2: Various bugs fixed.<BR>
  3.73 (04/09/2010)
  Fix bug where packetloss during slow start could cause retransmissions to stop.<BR>
  Add Lobby2Client_Steam plugin and corresponding sample, to support Steam published games using the Steamworks SDK.
  Fix RPC3 with writing bitstream pointers.

  Consolodate NAT traversal plugins into NATCompleteServer and NATCompleteClient samples. Remove old NAT samples.<BR>
  3.731 (05/01/2010) Document TeamBalancer and Steam lobby plugins. Fix crash with calling RakPeer::DetachPlugin(). Fix bug to return ID_SND_RECEIPT_ACKED only once for messages over the MTU. Rewrite RakNetStatistics to return more relevant and up to date information, including metrics per second. Add VariableDeltaSerializer, an optional helper class with ReplicaManager3 that can serialize changes per-variable, rather than relying on the default of serializing the entire object.<BR>
  3.80 (05/27/2010) Disabled UNRELIABLE_SEQUENCED_WITH_ACK_RECEIPT, RELIABLE_SEQUENCED_WITH_ACK_RECEIPT.

  Fix not threadsafe call to BPS tracker, caused crash when calling GetStatistics with version 3.731 or later.
  Increased tolerance for ping spikes with congestion control, speeds will increase more quickly on average now.
  Fixed RakPeer::SendOutOfBand, hould always return as the first byte ID_OUT_OF_BAND_INTERNAL.
  Allow Set() and constructor functions in RakString to take any size input.
  Fixed ConnectionGraph2 basically not working at all.
  Fixed http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/forum/index.php?topic=3216.0 where HTTPConnection would fail because TCP packets were still waiting while CloseConnection was called.
  Encode ping/pong in handshaking so a ping is always available when ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED or ID_NEW_INCOMING_CONNECTION arrives. This changes the protocol, so connections to prior versions are not possible.
  Fixed cross connections so both systems return ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED, and neither system returns ID_NEW_INCOMING_CONNECTION.<br>

When the lastUpdateDate is passed to AutopatcherClient::PatchApplication() and the corresponding patch is the most recent, disk access is not needed on the server, greatly improving performance.<BR>
	4.016 (3/14/2011)
	Add GetLowestAveragePingSystem to ConnectionGraph2.
	Add to manual about cloud hosting.<BR>
	4.017 (3/23/2011)
	Fix CloudServer returning wrong port to CloudClient when using forced addresses.
	Fix wrong connection count from CloudServerHelper
	Fix bug with FCM2 not being processed by other plugins.
	Return Notification_Console_RoomOwnerChanged on all systems, not only host, on xbox lobby.
	Disconnection notification right away on 360.<BR>
	4.018 (4/2/2011)
	Congestion control fix: Fixed bug with overagressive recovery using excessive bandwidth, which would cause packetloss in the usual case and dropped connections in the extreme case.
	High data-rate fix: If a duplicate ack arrived and more than DATAGRAM_MESSAGE_ID_ARRAY_LENGTH (512 by default) reliable messages had been sent or resent between the first ack and the duplicate, the wrong reliable message would be flagged as delivered. This would result in no further reliable messages would be returned to the user, although the connection would not be lost due to lost connection detection pings being unreliable.
	Speed optimization: Add a 128 byte stack block to InternalPacket which is used for outgoing packets to avoid a malloc. Make some DS_Heap operations inline.
	USE_THREADED_SEND: Now supported if added to RakNetDefines.h. The define creates a separate thread for calling sendto() for very high outgoing data-rates.
	Documentation: Added NAT Traversal architecture, detailing how to use NAT traversal components together.
	Statistics: Fixed packetloss not being multiplied by 100 in StatisticsToString. Fix overreported packetloss.
	TCPInterface: Added WasStarted(). Return correct SystemAddress for blocking connections. Fixed sends not working when using Open SSL (affects EmailSender class).
	RakString: Add SplitURI function.
	RELIABLE_WITH_ACK_RECEIPT: Fixed transmissing wrong value, causing datastream corruption when used.
	Rackspace: Added Rackspace.h, a C++ interface to Rackspace cloud servers.
	XBOX 360: Serialize room member names.
	PS3: public and private slot counts now returned per room.
	Added LocklessTypes.h, LocklessTypes.cpp to /Source to fix reported bug http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/forum/index.php?topic=4466.0 where RakPeer::Startup() would block forever.<BR>
