AWS is short for Amazon Web Services. These services are accessed through a C# SDK, available here: http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/
RakNet can interface with this SDK using callbacks when run from C# via SWIG using the directors feature.
This enables RakNet C++ code to access Amazon cloud features with a minimum of changes.
