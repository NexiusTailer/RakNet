On events:
- HOST DROPS
- ADD OR DROP PARTICIPANT WHEN NO HOST
- CHANGE PRIORITY WHEN NO HOST:

1. Clear all state information, except participant list
2. System A: (Host drops or add participant only) Send ID_FCM_HOST_QUERY to all remote participants. Set state to HOST_QUERYING for each remote participant
3. System A: If all systems are at or become state HOST_UNKNOWN (due to packet or participant drop), go to 4.
4. System A: For all remote participants, (referred to as system B), send ID_PARTICIPANT_LIST_UPDATE, priorityA, participantListA. set state of B to PARTICIPANT_LIST_TRANSMITTED.
5. System B: On ID_PARTICIPANT_LIST_UPDATE, Store priorityA, participantListA, state PARTICIPANT_LIST_RECEIVED for A
6. System B: If due to ID_PARTICIPANT_LIST_UPDATE, participant add, or participant drop, all stored participant lists now match our current list goto 7.
7. System B: Send ID_PARTICIPANT_LIST_MATCHED to all remote participants. Include priorityB, participantListB
8. System A: On ID_PARTICIPANT_LIST_MATCHED, If participantListB==participantListA, and priorityA==priorityAFromPacket, set state PARTICIPANT_LIST_MATCHED
9. System A: If all systems are state PARTICIPANT_LIST_MATCHED, set host by highest priority, lowest guid.
10. If you are now host, send ID_HOST,guid,priority to all participants.
11. If got ID_HOST, but think the host is different, then send ID_HOST,guid,priority to all systems. Set host to higher priority host.

ADD OR DROP PARTICIPANT WHEN WE ARE HOST

1. Send to participant ID_HOST,guid,priority
